  <img src="../images/cookies.png" alt="Corn" height="300" width="500">
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine wet and dry:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring just until combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
      <li><strong>Add chocolate chips and nuts:</strong> Stir in the chocolate chips and, if using, the nuts.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoop and shape:</strong> Use a spoon or cookie scoop to drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft. (The cookies will continue to cook slightly on the baking sheet once removed from the oven.)</li>
      <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
  <p>Enjoy your fresh, warm cookies with a glass of milk!</p>
