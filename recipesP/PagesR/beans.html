    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked beans (such as kidney, white, or navy beans)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter (or olive oil for a lighter version)</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (or fresh if available)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of spice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the beans:</strong> If you're using canned beans, drain and rinse them. If you're using dried beans, ensure they're cooked and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook garlic:</strong> In a large skillet, melt the butter (or heat olive oil) over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, but not browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Add beans:</strong> Stir in the cooked beans and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are heated through and slightly crispy at the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add lemon juice, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine, making sure all the beans are coated in the seasoning. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Top with freshly chopped parsley and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for some heat, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
    <p>This dish is great as a side to roasted chicken, grilled vegetables, or even as a snack on its own!</p>
