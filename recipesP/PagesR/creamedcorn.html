  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>4 cups of fresh or frozen corn kernels (about 4-5 ears of corn)</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk (whole milk works best)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional for thickening)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, for a little sweetness)</li>
      <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper or paprika (optional, for a little heat or flavor)</li>
      <li>Fresh herbs (like parsley or thyme) for garnish (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Corn:</strong> If using fresh corn, remove the husks and silk, then cut the kernels off the cob. If using frozen corn, thaw it out according to the package instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Make a Roux (Optional):</strong> In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir in the flour (if using) to make a roux, cooking it for about 1-2 minutes until the flour is lightly golden. This helps thicken the cream sauce later.</li>
      <li><strong>Add the Cream and Milk:</strong> Gradually pour in the heavy cream and milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Keep stirring until the mixture starts to thicken, which should take about 4-5 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook the Corn:</strong> Add the corn kernels to the saucepan, stirring to combine with the creamy mixture. Let it cook for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the corn to soften and absorb the cream. You can adjust the heat to low so the mixture doesnâ€™t boil too much.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Stir in salt and pepper to taste. Add a pinch of sugar for sweetness, and cayenne pepper or paprika for a hint of heat if desired.</li>
      <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Once the corn is tender and the sauce is creamy, remove the saucepan from the heat. Garnish with fresh herbs if you like, then serve warm.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Enjoy your creamy, comforting creamed corn! Perfect as a side dish for a variety of meals like roasted meats, mashed potatoes, or cornbread.</p>
